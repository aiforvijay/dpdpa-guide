      <p>The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, enacted on August 11, 2023, establishes a comprehensive framework for managing and
      safeguarding digital personal data in India. This legislation marks a significant shift in India's data protection regime, moving from a
      sector-specific approach to a holistic law.</p>

        title: '1.1. Background and legislative history of the Act',
        content: `
          <p>Until 2023, India operated without a standalone law specifically designed for data protection. The need for a comprehensive legal
          framework had been long recognized, evidenced by multiple previous attempts to enact such legislation that did not succeed in passing
          through the Indian Parliament. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, was finally published in the Official Gazette on August 11, 2023,
          marking a pivotal moment in India's journey towards establishing a robust data protection regime.</p>
          
          <p>The path to this enactment was marked by extensive deliberations and the evolution of the proposed legislation through several drafts over the years.
          The initial Data Protection Bill was introduced in 2018, followed by revisions in 2019 and 2021. Ultimately, these earlier versions were
          replaced by the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022, which, after further parliamentary processes, became the Digital Personal Data
          Protection Act, 2023.</p>
          
          <p>A noteworthy aspect of this Act is its use of "she/her" pronouns for individuals throughout the text, irrespective of gender, a first in Indian
          legislative history, signifying a progressive approach to legal language. The extended period and multiple iterations involved in the creation
          of the DPDPA underscore the complexity and the importance of establishing a well-considered data protection framework that balances various
          stakeholder interests.</p>

        content: `
          <p>The primary objective of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, is to govern the processing of digital personal data in a manner
          that acknowledges both the individual's right to protect their personal information and the necessity of processing such data for lawful
          purposes. The Act aims to safeguard the privacy of individuals concerning their personal data and to regulate the flow and usage of
          this information.</p>
          
          <p>Furthermore, it seeks to foster a relationship of trust between individuals and the entities that process their personal data, while also
          protecting the fundamental rights of individuals whose data is subject to processing. Several key principles underpin the DPDPA, including
          accountability, transparency, data minimization, fairness, accuracy, and the lawful processing of personal data.</p>
          
          <p>These principles serve as guiding tenets for interpreting and implementing the various provisions of the Act. The dual focus on protecting
          individual rights and enabling legitimate data processing highlights the delicate balance the legislation attempts to achieve, a balance that
          Chartered Accountants must appreciate to effectively advise businesses on navigating this new legal terrain.</p>

        title: '1.3. Scope and applicability of the Act',
        content: `
          <p>The DPDPA's scope extends to the processing of digital personal data within the territory of India. This includes personal data collected
          in a digital format as well as data initially collected in non-digital form that is subsequently digitized. Moreover, the Act has an
          extraterritorial application, as it also applies to the processing of digital personal data outside of India if such processing is related to
          offering goods or services to Data Principals located within India.</p>
          
          <p>This broad applicability means that both domestic and international organizations that engage with the personal data of individuals in India
          need to comply with the Act's requirements. However, certain categories of personal data are exempt from the Act's purview. These include
          personal data processed by an individual for personal or domestic purposes, and personal data that has been made publicly available by the
          Data Principal themselves or by someone legally obligated to do so.</p>
          
          <p>It is important to note that the DPDPA specifically governs personal data in digital form and does not regulate non-personal or non-digital data.
          Currently, the collection and handling of non-personal data remain unregulated in India, though there are acts which indirectly compensates
          the issues arising out of this concern. The extensive reach of the DPDPA, particularly its extraterritorial application, underscores the need for
          a wide range of organizations to understand and adhere to its stipulations. Chartered Accountants must be aware of this broad scope to
          properly advise their diverse clientele.</p>

          <p>A foundational understanding of the DPDPA requires familiarity with its key definitions:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Principal</strong> is the individual to whom the personal data relates. This definition encompasses parents or lawful guardians
            acting on behalf of children, and lawful guardians acting on behalf of persons with disabilities.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Data Fiduciary</strong> is any person who, either alone or in conjunction with others, determines the purpose and means of
            processing of personal data.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Data Processor</strong> is any person who processes personal data on behalf of a Data Fiduciary.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Consent Manager</strong> is registered with the Data Protection Board and serves as a single point of contact for Data Principals
            to give, manage, review, and withdraw their consent through an accessible, transparent, and interoperable platform. Consent Managers are
            accountable to the Data Principal.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Personal Data</strong> refers to any data about an individual who can be identified by or in relation to such data, and importantly,
            it is limited to data in digital form.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Processing</strong> is defined broadly to include any operation or set of operations performed on digital personal data, whether wholly
            or partly automated, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, use, and erasure.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Personal Data Breach</strong> occurs when there is any unauthorized processing or accidental disclosure, acquisition, or loss
            of access to personal data that compromises its confidentiality, integrity, or availability.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF)</strong> is an entity designated by the government based on factors like the volume and sensitivity
            of the data they process, and the potential risk associated with their processing activities. SDFs are subject to additional obligations under the Act.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>A thorough grasp of these definitions is fundamental for Chartered Accountants to accurately interpret and apply the provisions of the DPDPA
          in their professional advisory roles. The specific nuances in these definitions, such as the limitation of 'personal data' to the digital realm,
          are critical to understanding the Act's scope and implications.</p>

        title: '2.1. Lawful processing of personal data',
        content: `
          <p>The DPDPA mandates that personal data can only be processed for a lawful purpose, which is defined as any purpose not explicitly forbidden by law.
          This processing must be based on either the explicit consent of the Data Principal or for certain specified 'legitimate uses'.</p>
          
          <p>Consent must be freely given, specific to the purpose, informed, unconditional, unambiguous, and provided through a clear affirmative action
          by the Data Principal. Furthermore, the consent must be limited to only the personal data that is necessary for the specified purpose.</p>
          
          <p>Data Principals are empowered to give, manage, review, and withdraw their consent through an easily accessible, transparent, and interoperable platform,
          potentially facilitated by a registered Consent Manager. The process for withdrawing consent must be as straightforward as the process for giving it.</p>
          
          <p>The Act also outlines certain 'legitimate uses' for processing personal data without explicit consent, such as when an individual voluntarily
          provides their data for a specific purpose or when the processing is necessary for the State to provide a subsidy, benefit, service, license,
          certificate, or permit, provided the individual has previously consented to such processing.</p>

          <p>A fundamental aspect of the DPDPA is the requirement for Data Fiduciaries to provide a clear notice to the Data Principal on or before
          the collection of their personal data. This notice must convey specific information, including the personal data being collected, the purpose
          for which it is being processed, and details on how the Data Principal can exercise their rights under the Act and lodge complaints with the
          Data Protection Board.</p>
          
          <p>The language used in the notice must be clear, plain, and easily understandable, ensuring that Data Principals can make informed decisions
          about their data. To promote inclusivity and accessibility, Data Fiduciaries are also obligated to offer Data Principals the option to access
          both the consent request and the associated notice in English or any of the twenty-two languages recognized in the Eighth Schedule to the
          Constitution of India.</p>
          
          <p>The requirement for transparent and easily comprehensible privacy notices is paramount for obtaining informed consent, a cornerstone of the DPDPA.
          Chartered Accountants can provide valuable assistance to businesses in drafting these notices, ensuring they meet all legal requirements and
          are easily understood by Data Principals, particularly in a linguistically diverse country like India.</p>

          <p>The DPDPA empowers individuals by granting them several key rights concerning their personal data. These include:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to access information</strong>: Allows Data Principals to obtain confirmation from the Data Fiduciary regarding the processing
            of their data, along with a summary of the personal data being processed and the identities of all Data Fiduciaries and Data Processors involved.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Right to correction and erasure</strong>: Enables Data Principals to rectify any inaccuracies in their personal data and to request
            the erasure of their data when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Right of grievance redressal</strong>: Allows Data Principals to raise concerns and seek remedies from the Data Fiduciary or
            Consent Manager regarding any act or omission related to the processing of their personal data.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Right to nominate</strong>: Enables a Data Principal to designate another individual who can exercise their rights under the DPDPA
            in the event of their death or incapacity.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>These rights collectively empower Data Principals with greater control over their personal data. Chartered Accountants need to be well-versed

          emphasize to their clients the financial risks of non-compliance and the importance of implementing robust data protection measures to avoid
          these penalties.</p>

      <p>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) has released the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025,

        title: '3.1. Detailed procedures for notice and consent',
        content: `
          <p>The Draft Rules elaborate on the procedures for providing notice and obtaining consent from Data Principals. They specify that Data Fiduciaries
          must provide a clear and concise notice to Data Principals before collecting their personal data. This notice should be in simple language and
          should include:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>The personal data being collected and the purpose for its collection.</li>
            
            <li>The manner in which the personal data will be processed.</li>
            
            <li>Information about the Data Principal's rights and how to exercise them.</li>
            
            <li>The procedure for grievance redressal.</li>
            
            <li>The retention period for the personal data.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The Draft Rules also emphasize that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, and must be indicated through a clear
          affirmative action. They provide for the withdrawal of consent, specifying that Data Principals should be able to withdraw their consent as
          easily as they gave it.</p>
          
          <p>These detailed procedures aim to ensure that Data Principals are fully informed about the processing of their personal data and can make
          meaningful choices about whether to consent to such processing. Chartered Accountants can assist businesses in developing compliant notice
          and consent mechanisms that meet these requirements.</p>

        title: '3.2. Registration and obligations of Consent Managers',
        content: `
          <p>The Draft Rules outline the process for the registration of Consent Managers and their obligations under the DPDPA. Consent Managers are
          entities that enable Data Principals to give, manage, review, and withdraw their consent for the processing of their personal data through
          an accessible, transparent, and interoperable platform.</p>
          
          <p>To register as a Consent Manager, an entity must meet certain criteria, including having a secure and user-friendly platform, implementing
          appropriate data protection measures, and having a clear business model. Once registered, Consent Managers have several obligations, including:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Maintaining accurate records of consent given by Data Principals.</li>
            
            <li>Ensuring the security and confidentiality of the consent data.</li>
            
            <li>Providing Data Principals with easy access to their consent records.</li>
            
            <li>Facilitating the withdrawal of consent when requested by a Data Principal.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The Draft Rules also specify that Consent Managers must act in the best interests of the Data Principals they serve and must not use the
          personal data they handle for any purpose other than managing consent. These provisions aim to create a trusted intermediary that can help
          Data Principals effectively manage their consent preferences across multiple Data Fiduciaries.</p>

        title: '3.3. Standards for processing personal data for specific purposes',
        content: `
          <p>The Draft Rules establish standards for processing personal data for specific purposes, particularly in the context of 'legitimate uses'
          as defined in the DPDPA. These standards aim to ensure that even when personal data is processed without explicit consent, it is done in a
          manner that respects the rights and interests of the Data Principal.</p>
          
          <p>For instance, when personal data is processed for the provision of a service or benefit by the State, the Draft Rules specify that:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Only the personal data necessary for the specific purpose should be collected.</li>
            
            <li>The data should not be used for any other purpose without the Data Principal's consent.</li>
            
            <li>Appropriate security measures must be implemented to protect the data.</li>
            
            <li>The data should be deleted once the purpose for its collection is fulfilled, unless retention is required by law.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Similarly, for other legitimate uses such as employment purposes, responding to medical emergencies, or compliance with court orders,
          the Draft Rules provide specific standards to ensure that the processing is limited to what is necessary and proportionate to the purpose.</p>
          
          <p>These standards help to balance the need for certain types of data processing with the protection of individual privacy rights.
          Chartered Accountants advising businesses that rely on legitimate uses for data processing should ensure that their clients adhere to
          these specific standards.</p>

        content: `
          <p>The Draft Rules emphasize the need for Data Fiduciaries and Consent Managers to be transparent and proactive in enabling Data Principals
          to exercise their rights under the DPDPA. To this end, they are required to prominently publish on their websites or apps updated and detailed
          information regarding the statement of Data Principal rights as outlined in the Act, along with clear guidance on the means through which
          Data Principals can access the services of the Data Fiduciary or Consent Manager.</p>
          
          <p>This includes providing specific information on how individuals can exercise their rights to access, correct, and erase their personal data,
          as well as their rights to grievance redressal and to nominate another individual to exercise their rights on their behalf.</p>
          
          <p>Regarding the right to erasure, the Draft Rules specify that if a Data Principal does not engage with a Data Fiduciary for a specified period,
          the Data Fiduciary must notify the Data Principal in advance (say, 30 days as illustration) that their personal data will be deleted upon the
          completion of that period. This erasure is not required if the retention of the data is necessary for compliance with any other applicable law.</p>
          
          <p>These provisions in the Draft Rules underscore the importance of making it easy for Data Principals to understand and exercise their rights
          under the DPDPA. Chartered Accountants can assist businesses in developing and implementing user-friendly mechanisms to facilitate this.</p>

        content: `
          <p>The Draft Rules provide detailed guidance on what constitutes 'reasonable security safeguards' that Data Fiduciaries are required to implement
          to protect personal data and prevent data breaches. The rules specify a minimum set of measures, including:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>The use of encryption, obfuscation, or anonymization techniques.</li>
            
            <li>The implementation of appropriate access control measures.</li>
            
            <li>The establishment of processes for detecting and investigating unauthorized access and taking remedial actions to prevent recurrence.</li>
            
            <li>Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>In the event of a personal data breach, the Draft Rules mandate that Data Fiduciaries must, upon becoming aware of the breach, promptly notify
          each affected Data Principal in a concise, clear, and unambiguous manner. This notification should include details about the nature of the breach,
          the likely consequences arising from it, the measures taken by the Data Fiduciary to address the breach, and the steps the Data Principal can take
          to safeguard their interests.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, Data Fiduciaries are required to notify the Data Protection Board without undue delay upon becoming aware of a personal data breach.
          The Draft Rules also stipulate that Data Fiduciaries must maintain a record of all personal data breaches for a period of one year, unless otherwise
          required by law.</p>
          
          <p>The detailed guidance on security safeguards and breach notification procedures in the Draft Rules is crucial for businesses in developing their
          data security protocols and incident response plans. Chartered Accountants can provide valuable advice on implementing these requirements effectively.</p>

        content: `
          <p>The Draft Rules further elaborate on the requirements for processing the personal data of children and persons with disabilities. They reiterate
          the necessity for Data Fiduciaries to obtain verifiable consent from parents or legal guardians before processing the personal data of children or
          persons with disabilities under legal guardianship.</p>
          
          <p>To facilitate this, the rules specify that Data Fiduciaries can verify the identity of an individual claiming to be a parent or guardian by
          referencing reliable details of identity and age already available with the Data Fiduciary or through voluntarily provided details of identity and age.
          The Draft Rules also suggest that consent can be recorded through details already available or submitted by the parent, or through a virtual token
          provided by entities like Digital Locker.</p>
          
          <p>In the context of data retention, the Draft Rules specify that if a Data Principal (or a child's parent or guardian) does not engage with a
          Data Fiduciary within a specified period, the Data Fiduciary must erase their personal data unless its retention is necessary for compliance with any law.</p>
          
          <p>These detailed rules aim to provide practical guidance on how to comply with the Act's stringent requirements for protecting the data of these
          vulnerable groups. Chartered Accountants advising businesses that handle such data need to be particularly aware of these specific procedures and
          verification methods.</p>

          <p>The Draft Rules reinforce the enhanced obligations placed on Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs). These entities are required to conduct annual
          Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and comprehensive audits of their data processing practices, and the results of these assessments and
          audits must be reported to the Data Protection Board.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, SDFs are mandated to designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who must be situated in India. This DPO will serve as the SDF's
          representative for ensuring compliance with the DPDPA and will be the primary point of contact for addressing any grievances related to data processing.
          The appointed DPO must be an individual who is responsible to the board of directors or a similar governing body of the SDF.</p>
          
          <p>These provisions in the Draft Rules underscore the higher level of accountability and scrutiny expected of SDFs due to the volume and sensitivity

          <p>The Draft Rules align with the Digital India initiative by outlining that the Data Protection Board of India will primarily function as a digital office.
          This "digital by design" approach is intended to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and speed of the Board's operations in resolving grievances and
          enforcing compliance with the DPDPA.</p>
          
          <p>Through this digital framework, Data Principals will be able to file complaints, track their progress, and seek resolutions online, minimizing the
          need for physical interactions. This digital-first philosophy also extends to consent mechanisms and data management workflows, aiming to streamline
          processes for both Data Fiduciaries and Data Principals, thereby fostering greater trust in the system.</p>

      <p>Key compliance requirements for entities handling personal data in the country will mirror the obligations of Data Fiduciaries and SDFs.

      <p>The linguistic diversity of the country necessitates that information and compliance processes are accessible in local languages. Potential for
      misinterpretations or lack of clarity in understanding the Act and Rules might also be a factor to consider.</p>
